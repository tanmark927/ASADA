		<h2><a name="about_asada">About ASADA</a></h2>

		<p>The Alexa anti-depression project is an idea by Dr. Eleazar Eskin in an attempt to help alleviate people suffering with depression. Alexa Support Anti Depression Application (ASADA) is a Alexa application that is built using Node.js and Alexa Skills Kit. The main purpose of ASADA is to help users cope with struggling with depression and lower their depression levels by talking to Alexa on a consistently based on their mental well-being.</p>

		<p>Depression is a mental disease that millions of people suffer from every year and the number of people affected by depression grow every year. In 2012, in the United States alone, the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 6.9 percent of the population has had at least one depression episode. This is approximately 16 million people and the numbers will only keep increasing as time goes by. In a broader perspective, a report from Columbia University shows that in 2015, the percentage of people affected by depression increased by 12.7 percent.</p>

		<p>The proposed project ASADA will listen to a speaking user provided that the user says the vocal command to trigger the application. Once the application has interpreted a user’s input, it will then respond with one of several responses that will attempt to converse with the user serving as an emotional outlet or pillar for the user. This allows the user to cope with his or her depression symptoms.</p>

		<p>The goal of ASADA is to help cope with the user’s depression in that it lets the user know someone cares enough to check up on them. This shall help lower the steadily increasing rates of depression that affect millions of people per year. The program matters because depression is increasing at a fast pace in America with yearly studies showing increasing numbers of those affected by depression. ASADA will serve as an emotional support pillar that aims to help lower/decrease severity of depression symptoms and provide social support to aid the user with their symptoms.</p>

		<h2><a name="getting_started">Getting Started</a></h2>
		
		<p>ASADA requires an Alexa-enabled device such as the Amazon Echo and a smartphone with the Android operating system installed with a version equal to or greater than 5.0. If you already have the two devices, all that is needed is for you to install the ASADA app from the Google Play Store. In addition, you are required to have an Amazon account as that is how user validation is done within the app. Currently, ASADA is not available for iOS devices.</p>

		<h2><a name="home_page">Home Page (Android Beta)</a></h2>
		<image src="https://i.imgur.com/pIu1YFF.jpg" alt="homepage">
		<p>This is the main page in which you can perform interactions with the Alexa-enabled device such as creating a targeted conversation and access the most recent Alexa responses. In the lower right corner of the page is an icon that, when selected, will take you to the account page. In the middle of the page is a button that, when selected, will take you to the history page, and below that is a button that will allow the app to sync with Alexa. This page only has a few functions in order to provide an accessible interface for everyone.</p>

		<h2><a name="account_page">Account Page (Android Beta)</a></h2>
		<image src="https://i.imgur.com/j1JBq4Q.jpg" alt="account">
		<p>This page contains personal account information, including username and email. Your name, email, and birthdate are all information you entered when you signed up for ASADA. The page also includes the activity bar chart that shows you what days and how long spent talking to Alexa by recording your time spent on the app.</p>

		<h2><a name="sync">Sync With Alexa (Android Beta)</a></h2>
		<p>In order for you, the user, to interact with an Alexa-enabled device using ASADA, the application must first sync to it. On the main page of the ASADA app, there will be a spiral shaped button called sync. That main page is automatically loaded when you open up the ASADA app. Tapping on the sync button will allow you to connect ASADA to the Alexa-enabled device so that you can begin interacting with Alexa through the app.</p>

		<h2><a name="history_page">History Page (Android Beta)</a></h2>
		<image src="https://i.imgur.com/GvWnHr4.jpg" alt="history">
		<p>This page contains the chat history between you and the Alexa-enabled device. When the user goes to ASADA's history view chat history button, the user will be taken to a page where the user can view their chat history with ASADA. This chat history contains the users chatlogs with Alexa, including the timestamps on the conversation such as the date and time of the conversation. The user's verbal conversation with Alexa is recorded and transcribed into text for you to be able to review your conversation with Alexa.</p>

		<h2><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

		<h4>Can the ASADA client be used on a computer?</h4>
		<p>The ASADA client is only intended for use on Android devices that support version 5.0 or above. Therefore, ASADA cannot be used on a computer.</p>

		<h4>Is ASADA available for iOS devices?</h4>
		<p>ASADA is only available on Android at the moment. Plans for an iOS version of the app are to be determined.</p>

		<h4>Do I need to use the Android client to interact with ASADA?</h4>
		<p>The purpose of the Android client is to provide users an easy way to use ASADA with visual aid. However, as long as ASADA is installed on the Alexa-enabled device, it should still be available for use. Therefore, the use of Android client is not necessary to interact with ASADA.</p>

		<h4>Does ASADA cure one's depression?</h4>
		<p>Although ASADA's goal is to provide advice that will take a user out of depression, it is intended to do so at a slower pace. It is not guaranteed that solely using this app will cure the symptoms of depression. Therefore, it is recommended that the app is used as part of the transition process.</p>

		<h4>Do I need a specific Alexa-enabled device to use this app, such as the Amazon Echo?</h4>
		<p>All Alexa-enabled devices are equally capable of interacting with ASADA. Therefore, it is not necessary to specifically get an Amazon Echo.</p>
