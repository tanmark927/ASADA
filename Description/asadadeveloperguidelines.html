		<h2><a name="intro">What is this project?</a></h2>
		<p>ASADA is an <b>A</b>lexa <b>S</b>upport <b>A</b>nti-<b>D</b>epression <b>A</b>pplication that aims to help alleviate people suffering from depression. The main purpose of this project is to help users cope with struggling with depression and lower their depression levels by talking to Alexa on a daily basis. It aims to give its user other things to do in order to take its depressed user to focus on their depression.  These include many fun activities including a fortune-cookie event.</p>

		<h2><a name="compdep">Components and Dependencies</a></h2>
		<p>
			We used the <a href = "https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa Skill Kit</a> to create the Alexa app. From there, we used the development GUI 
			to create our intents and sample utterances. From there, we connected the Alexa app to an <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/Amazon">AWS Lambda</a> function. 
			In the Lambda function, we are programming with the <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Python</a> language, along with <a href = "https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyMySQL</a> 
			to connect to our database. The database is built on <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a>, since we wanted to stick with strictly 
			Amazon Web Services. From our understanding, how the Alexa program works is that Alexa will listen to commands over voice, and figures out the utterance 
			or intent on its own, and sends the intent command to Lambda. From Lambda, it will generate the response there and will access the database with our PyMySQL 
			dependency. Then Lambda sends back the response of the utterance to Alexa, and Alexa will speak out the response. We also used <a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">Android Studio 3.1.1</a> 
			to create our android app, which is based on <a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html">Java</a> and the Android 
			development kit.

		<h2><a name="contribute">How to Contribute</a></h2>
		<p>
			You can contribute to this by going to our <a href = "https://github.com/tanmark927/ASADA">Github page.</a></br>
			<b>We encourage that you create your own branch, and create any pull requests for us to review</b></br></br>
			The current issues can be viewed on our <a href = "https://github.com/tanmark927/ASADA/issues">Issues page.</a>
			</br></br></br>
			You first need an <b>AWS developer account and an Amazon account</b>. (they both have different set up processes) </br>
			You then need to set up instances of Lambda, and RDS. Set the constraints so that it is running on Linux and MYSQL instances for RDS.</br>
			You can copy over our SQL code from the github to build the RDS database. You can follow this <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/connect-rds-mysql-workbench/">tutorial</a> to connect to your RDS database from mySQL workbench. Be sure to open port 3306 in your security groups.</br>
			Then, you need to create an Alexa Skill for the testing. Then you need to link both the Lambda function and The Skill. Amazon has a great tutorial for this. <a href ="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial">Tutorial</a></br>
			You can copy our JSON code to the Alexa Skill, and our Python code to the Lambda function.</br>
			</br>
			If you do not want to follow the steps, we can provide AWS accounts on contact with us at <a href ="mailto:asadadasadadepression@gmail?Subject=AWS%20Information%20Request">asadadepression@gmail.com</a></br>
			But be warned, we do not give this out to anybody.

		<h2><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>
		<h4>How was the database connected to that application?</h4>
		<p>The lambda function connects to an ECS server in order to communicate with RDS.</p>
		
		<h4>I cannot connect to my RDS database. Help?!</h4>
		<p>You have to set the security group to accept inbounds and outbounds of port 3306. That way, MySQL will be able to connect</p>
		
		<h4>My Alexa function is failing to run</h4>
		<p>There is an error in the Lambda function. You need to check your code over, and ensure there is not any errors.</br>
		If you are confident there are no errors, check that your Lambda function is connected to your Alexa Skill</p>
